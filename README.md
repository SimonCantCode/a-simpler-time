# A simpler time
Replaces the year 2026 with 2016 on google calendar. I call this level of nostalgia "toxic nostalgia".

This was almost entierly vibe-coded, no human should ever have to write j\*vascript lol

## Known bugs im too lazy to fix
The left and right buttons at the top to change what week you are focused on will reaload the text and cause it to break. I tried to fix it at first but eh, who cares. Im supprised if anyone is even reading this xd.

## Installation
Since I was too lazy to make this into a real extension, you will have to import it (the contents of main.js) to your browser using a userscript manager like Greasemonkey, there are many other better tutorials on how to do this.
